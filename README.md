#### How It Works
SiteScraper follows these steps:

1. `Initial Crawl`: Downloads the main page of the target site.

 
 2. ` Recursive Crawling`: Finds all internal links, then recursively crawls and saves them.

  
 3. `Asset Handling`: Downloads and saves linked assets (CSS, JS, images).


 4. `File Structure Preservation`: Saves files with the same structure as the original website, maintaining directories and paths.
