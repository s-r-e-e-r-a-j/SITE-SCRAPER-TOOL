SiteScraper

SiteScraper is an ethical hacking and website cloning tool built with Python. It enables users to download entire websites for offline access, analysis, and security assessments. Designed for ethical hackers, researchers, and developers, SiteScraper recursively crawls pages, follows internal links, and saves assets like HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript, while preserving the original structure of the site

How It Works
SiteScraper follows these steps:

1. Initial Crawl: Downloads the main page of the target site.

 
2.  Recursive Crawling: Finds all internal links, then recursively crawls and saves them.

  
3. Asset Handling: Downloads and saves linked assets (CSS, JS, images).


4. File Structure Preservation: Saves files with the same structure as the original website, maintaining directories and paths.
